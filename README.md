# Sign-up-Form
This is a project from the Odin Project in which one is tasked to create a sign-up form for a webpage.

Originally I designed this to have animated inputs in which the labels would shift upwards and shrink. That will be coming very soon. 

There are a few additional updates also coming soon, including animated validations.
